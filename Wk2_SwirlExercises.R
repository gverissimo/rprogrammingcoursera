# You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the
# Esc key. If you are already at the prompt, type bye() to exit and save your
# progress. When you exit properly, you'll see a short message letting you know
# you've done so.
#
# When you are at the R prompt (>):
# -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
# -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
#    - UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
# -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
# -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
# -- Typing info() displays these options again.

# create a random mix of NA and samples from a normal distribution 
# by creating 1000 samples of each and then taking 100 random samples from each:
#   y <- rnorm(1000) #vector of 1000 samples drawn from normal distribution
#   z <- rep(NA, 1000) #vector of 1000 NA
#   my_data <- sample(c(y,z),100) # 100 random samples drown from union(y,z)
